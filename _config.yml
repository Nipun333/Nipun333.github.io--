  ## The things I currently have the most experience are: <mark>Node.Js</mark>, <mark>Javascript</mark>, <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Typescript</mark>, <mark>PostgreSQL</mark>, <mark>Tailwind CSS</mark> and <mark>git</mark>. 
  ## I have also knowledge on: <mark>Blockchain</mark> & <mark>Competitive Programming</mark>

more_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs # This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
# Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
