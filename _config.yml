about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  ## Hi, my name is Anis, I’m a full stack web developer with over 1 year experience. I used to work for the MGH Group as a full stack software engineer on a freight forwarding web platform. 
  ## I enjoy making clean, readable and modular code. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. 
  ## The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>ES6 Javascript</mark>, <mark>DevOps</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>React & Redux</mark>, <mark>TypeScript</mark>,<mark>MERN</mark> and <mark>git</mark>. 
  ## I have also working knowledge on SDLC: <mark>Scrum</mark> & <mark>DSDM</mark>

# You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as 
#   - Lists
#   - Tables
#   - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#   - Images
