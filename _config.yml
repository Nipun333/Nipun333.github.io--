  ## The things that I currently have the most experience working with are: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>ES6 Javascript</mark>, <mark>DevOps</mark>, <mark>SQL</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>React & Redux</mark>, <mark>TypeScript</mark>,<mark>MERN</mark> and <mark>git</mark>. 
  ## I have also working knowledge on SDLC: <mark>Scrum</mark> & <mark>DSDM</mark>

          I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Markdown</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
